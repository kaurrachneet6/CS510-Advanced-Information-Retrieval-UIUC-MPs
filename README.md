# CS510-MPs
CS510 Advanced Information Retrieval (UIUC) Machine Problems

**Problem 1:**

Implementat two-stage smoothing method for a language model-based ranker using the two classical language model-based ranking methods namely Dirichlet prior and Jelinek-Mercer algorithm.

**Problem 2:**

Implementat word embeddings via a K rank Singular Value Decomposition method. Next, the word embeddings are compared against a state-of-the-art method based on matrix factorization called GloVe using an analogy and similarity task.

**Problem 3:**

Implementat the EM algorithm for the PLSA with the background topic model using smoothing technique.

**Problem 4:**

Implementat various Hidden Markov Model heuristics namely:
1. Forward algorithm
2. Backward algorithm
3. Viterbi algorithm
4. Viterbi algorithm with smoothing 

**Final Project:** Implementation of pairwise learning to rank in MeTA.

Code for the final project is available on github at: https://github.com/mihikadave/meta/tree/ltr_rerank
