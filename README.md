CS510 Advanced Information Retrieval (UIUC) Machine Problems

**Problem 1:**

Implementat two-stage smoothing method for a language model-based ranker using the two classical language model-based ranking methods namely Dirichlet prior and Jelinek-Mercer algorithm.

**Problem 2:**

Implementat word embeddings via a K rank Singular Value Decomposition method. Next, the word embeddings are compared against a state-of-the-art method based on matrix factorization called GloVe using an analogy and similarity task.
